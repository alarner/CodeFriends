# Austin Front-end Engineering Pre-work
Three months is a short amount of time to teach you everything you need to know to be a great front-end developer. To make sure that we can move as fast as possible and cover all of the topics that we need to cover, I've put together a list of exercises and reading materials to get you up to speed. Please complete this work before the first day of class.

I expect you to be able to complete these exercises on your own. but if you run into trouble you're welcome to email me: aaron@theironyard.com.

### Assignments App
You will use GitHub and a custom built assignments app to turn in homework over the course of the class. I want you to get used to doing this before class begins, so you will turn in your pre-work through this process as well.

1. Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name.
2. Sign in to the [assignment app](http://assignments.nutellahabit.com) using your GitHub account. As you complete assignments, submit them there.

### JavaScript:
We will spend most of our time talking about JavaScript. JavaScript allows us to add interactions to our web applications.

Complete the Kahn Academy course at https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming (if you did the Codecademy course that's fine too, but I think Kahn Academy is better).

This is not how our course will be taught ­­ but it’s great to get yourself as familiar as possible with some of the syntax of the language.

Take a screen shot of the completion screen showing that you've completed all of the tasks. Email the screenshot to me with a title of "JavaScript Pre-Work"

### HTML/CSS:
HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we will only be spending about two weeks on HTML and CSS, so having a basic foundation before class will be very helpful.

Complete the Codecademy course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web. This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience.

<!-- Take a screen shot of the completion screen showing that you've completed all of the tasks. Upload the screenshot to [imgur](http://imgur.com/) or another photo sharing service and submit a link to the picture on the "HTML/CSS Pre-Work" assignment within the [assignment app](http://assignments.nutellahabit.com). -->

### Command Line
Mastery of command line basics is essential for any developer (and extremely useful for non­devs) and will make your life much easier. Go through the following tutorial, paying special attention to the instructions to create notecards for memorization. You won't have to memorize many things in this course, but memorizing command line commands is essential: http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/

Take a photo of the note cards that you created. They don't all have to be visible, just show me that you actually created them. Email the picture to me with a title of "Command Link Pre-Work"
