# GitHub Practice

We want to track the history of the work you do throughout the course using git and GitHub. Your goal is to make some changes to your `codefriends` repository, commit and then push them to GitHub.

## Getting started

1. If you don't already have a git repository that's connected to GitHub set up in your `codefriends` directory then set that up first. Follow the steps we learned in class.
2. Using the bash script that you created in the [Command Line Wizard](../command-line-wizard) assignment, create a new directory for `003-javascript-introduction`
3. Using your knowledge of git, add and commit the new files that your bash script created. Your commit message should be `Add a new directory for day 003`.
4. Push your new commit to GitHub and check your repository on github.com to make sure that the new `003-javascript-introduction` directory shows up.

## Prepping for next class

Now that you have your day 003 directory set up, let's prep for next class by doing some reading and taking some notes.

1. Read [JavaScript Introduction](../../units/javascript-introduction) and write down **three things you learned** as well as **three questions** you have about Javascript in the `codefriends/003-javascript-introduction/notes.md` file.
2. Using your knowledge of git, add and commit the new files that your bash script created. Your commit message should be `Notes on JavaScript Introduction reading assignment`.
3. Push your new commit to GitHub and check your repository on github.com to make sure that the `notes.md` file contains your new notes.
4. Read [JavaScript Primitives](../../units/javascript-primitives) and write down **three things you learned** as well as **three questions** you have about primitives in the `codefriends/003-javascript-introduction/notes.md` file.
5. Using your knowledge of git, add and commit the new files that your bash script created. Your commit message should be `Notes on JavaScript Primitives reading assignment`.
6. Push your new commit to GitHub and check your repository on github.com to make sure that the `notes.md` file contains your new notes.

## Viewing your repository history

1. Visit your repository on github.com
2. Copy the URL of your repository and post it in Discord #day-002-git-introduction channel to share with your instructors and classmates.
3. Look for the Commits link underneath the green `Code` button. Click on that link to view your commit history.
4. Make sure it includes the three commits that you created during this assignment.


## Bonus #1

> Not required but a good challenge if you have extra time

[Watch this video on git branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDmYNK68IEc). See if you can create a new branch in your `codefriends` repository and add some commits to the new branch. Finally see if you can successfully push that new branch to GitHub. Branches are a feature of git that we will use in the future, especially when we are collaborating with each other. In this video you'll see the default branch is `master`. In your case it will be called `main`, but otherwise the behavior should be equivalent. Also the video uses sublime text instead of VS Code, but you can do all the same things in VS Code.
