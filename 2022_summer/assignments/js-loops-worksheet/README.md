## Assignment
For each of the challenges below, create a node script that determines the correct answer. Add and commit those files to a new folder in your codefriends directory and push those files to GitHub.

### Challenge #1

If we list all the whole numbers between 1 and 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Challenge #2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of the even valued numbers in the Fibonacci sequence between 1 and four million.


### Challenge #3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


## Bonus #1

Create a command line script that will add positive numbers. For example:

`node ./add.js 1+1` should output 2

`node ./add.js 1+1+1` should output 3

`node ./add.js 12.5+100.1+33` should output 145.6

## Bonus #2

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
