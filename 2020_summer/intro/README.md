# Welcome to The Iron Yard Frontend Engineering Course in Austin

I'm super excited to have you all join me for what will be a really fun and exciting three months. Below you'll find a bunch of useful information to get you prepared and started learning how to code. One of our awesome instructors in Houston put most of this together. Thanks [Matt](http://github.com/matthiasak)!

Cheers!

Aaron

# Schedule

- Class is from `January 5th` to `March 27th`.
- Lecture is from `9.30 AM to 12:30 or 1 PM Monday-Thursday`, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later. :-)
- Lab time is from `1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday` and `9 AM to 5 PM` on Friday!

# Office hours and one-on-one instruction

I will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with me. After hours, I may be available in the classroom or in [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/), which we will use for group communication.

# Materials

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop to class. I recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should purchase is 8GB of RAM. I have had one for several years, I use it almost too often, and it has never failed on me. :-)

Your MacBook must be running [OS X Yosemite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12), which is a free upgrade from the App Store. [Download and install it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12) if you haven't yet.

# Prework

[/intro/PREWORK.md](/intro/PREWORK.md)
<!-- Here is some prework to prepare for The Iron Yard's Front End Course!

Prework is material to help you get on the same page as others. Do the best you can, and let Aaron know how it's going! :-)

What is prework?

- a series of base information designed to bring you up to speed as much as possible before the class. We have some online coursework, tools, and advanced materials for those of you who want to go further.
- starting learning before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This prework is training for your brain.
- Prework only covers the basics of a language; What we teach goes much deeper than tutorials can cover.

### JavaScript
> This is not how our course will be taught ­­ but it’s great to get yourself as familiar as 
possible with some of the syntax of the language. 

http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript 
 
### HTML/CSS:
> HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. However, we 
will only be spending about a week on HTML and CSS, so having a basic foundation before 
class will be very helpful. 
 
Check out the Codecademy course at http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web. 
This should take you approximately 7 hours, depending on your prior experience. 
 
 
### GitHub:
> GitHub is a web­based hosting and communication service for software development projects 
that uses the Git revision control system. 
 
Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ 
 
Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your 
name. 
 
Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn 
how to use GitHub prior to class.  
 
### Programmers’ Tools:
 
Command Line: Mastery of command line basics is essential for any developer (and 
extremely useful for non­devs) and will make your life much easier. 
 
http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ 
 
Git: Git and version control are central to how we will be working on projects. This may 
be a bit much to fully wrap your head around before class, but it’s worth a read to start 
getting familiar with the terms and concepts.

# Policies

Sounds boring, but these are important:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 12 midnight on the assigned day. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You are expected to do your own work. If you don't, why are you here? You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code is prohibited: you should use it only for inspiration or as a library in a bigger project. Copying homework is taken very seriously and can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally spoken, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Got an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, and we generally care for the well-being of our students.**

# Final Projects

> Also called the *Capstone Projects*

This is going to be a large project that you will carry out **BY YOURSELF OR WITH A RAILS STUDENT** to show off on Demo Day.

More information on your final project will be posted here as demo day draws closer.
