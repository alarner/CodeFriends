# JavaScript Variables and Types Worksheet

## Description

Build out a simple mobile website using HTML and CSS

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should…

- be able to target and style elements with CSS
- use Digital Color Meter to determine colors of things on your screen
- understand how to use pixels to specify measurements in CSS
- understand the difference between a head tag and a header tag

## Assignment

Using your knowledge of HTML and CSS, replicate the mobile layout displayed in [this image file](./page1.png) in a file called `index.html`.

Next, replicate the mobile layout displayed in [this image file](./page2.png) in a file called `page2.html`.

You'll notice that only the first layout has pixel dimensions labeled for you. You must determine the correct measurements for yourself for the second page. Command+Shift+4 is your friend.

Put all of your css for both pages in a `main.css` file within a css directory within your dist directory.

Your home page (`index.html`) and your second page (`page2.html`) should have links to each other (see the navigation at the top of the files). Additionally, you should add one more external link to a website of your choice on either your home page or second page.

The page should be responsive, meaning that if the browser window expands, the colored blocks should expand with it. However spacing between elements should remain fixed.

## Bonus

Trim down your total HTML to 1650 characters or fewer **while maintaining proper indentation and understandable class names**. It's no good if your markup is unreadable.

Trim down your total CSS to 2000 characters or fewer **while maintaining proper indentation and understandable class names**. It's no good if your CSS is unreadable.

_The goal here is to make your code as efficient as possible. Cut out all the unnecessary markup and styling_.

Other things to try if you have time: modify your normal mode assignment to add a bio of yourself to one of the boxes. Add a drop shadow to the text. Modify 4 other boxes to have a drop shadow. The drop shadow should disappear when you mouse over a box.

## Notes

You will need to use either the CSS margin or padding properties to get the layout correct. What is the difference between margin and padding?

To measure the size of elements and the space between them you can use `⌘ + shift + 4` then click and drag. Normally this will take a screen shot, but it will also show the pixel dimensions of the area you are selecting. You can press `space bar` while you are in the middle of a drag to move the entire selection.

I recommend downloading the image file and viewing it in preview at 100% zoom for accurate measurements.

Make sure that after you finish your second page, your first page still looks correct. A common mistake is to have CSS rules overwrite each other.
