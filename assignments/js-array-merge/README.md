## Description

Practice interview style questions.

## Objectives

Practice developing your own algorithms.

## Assignment

Create a function that take in two sorted arrays `a` and `b` and return a new array that has both
the contents of `a` and `b` in sorted order.

For example, if

```
const a = [1,4,7,9,10];
const b = [4,5,7,8,13];

const c = mergeSortedArrays(a, b);
// [1,4,4,5,7,7,8,9,10,13]
```

## Bonus 1

- Re-write your function without using any built-in sorting functions.

## Bonus 2

- Run your function in a loop 2000 times. Keep track of how long the script takes to run and optimize the performance as much as possible. How quickly can your code run 2000 times?
