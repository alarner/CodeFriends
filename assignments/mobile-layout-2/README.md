# Mobile Layout 2

## Description

Practice your git skills while developing a mobile layout for the wordpress.com home page in stages.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

- be able to target and style elements with CSS
- use Digital Color Meter to determine colors of things on your screen
- understand how to use rems to specify measurements in CSS

## Assignment

- The page should not be a fixed width, but instead scale as the browser window expands or shrinks. Margins and spacing should not be effected by resizing the window.

## Normal Mode

Over the course of this assignment you will develop the mobile version of a previous [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com) website design. The project is broken into four stages. The stages will take you through laying out the scaffolding for the page, filling in styles, text and finally images. You should follow each stage, don't skip! YOu should commit your changes at least once per stage, but you can commit more frequently.

- Use `cmd`+`shift`+`4` (Mac) or [pixelzoomer](http://pixelzoomer.com/) (Windows) to take measurements
- Use Digital Color Meter (Mac) or Digital Colorimeter (Windows) to determine the correct colors.

## Notes
